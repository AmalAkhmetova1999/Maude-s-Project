            Stockholm is built on 14 islands connected by 57 bridges. The Old Town was first occupied in about 1000 AD
            by the vikings. The city is said to be founded by Birger Jarl in 1252. The first part in the name Stock
            means log in Swedish and the second part holm means islet.<br><br>

            of Stockholm City Hall for a fantastic view of Stockholm and see the great hall that host the Nobel dinner
